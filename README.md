## Educational Organisation - ServiceNow Update Set

The **"Educational Organisation using ServiceNow"** is complete educational management system. It includes custom tables like `u_admission`, `u_salesforce`, and `u_student_progress` for managing admissions, student records, and academic progress. Key features include form layouts, choice lists, access controls, roles, and process flows (e.g., "In progress", "Rejoined"). It also automates tasks such as auto-populating student details and organizes modules for streamlined data management within the ServiceNow platform.
